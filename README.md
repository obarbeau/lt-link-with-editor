# Link with editor

Light Table plugin for linking the file currently edited with the workspace
view.

## Installation

Install from the `plugin manager` within Light Table
or clone this repository into your Light Table plugins folder.
You might need to run `Refresh plugin list`, and `Reload app behaviors`
commands after installation.

If you like the highlighted workspace element to be CSS-styled, just add a
`linked-with-editor` entry in your Light Table's theme, for example:

```css
.linked-with-editor {
  background-color: steelblue;
}
```

## Usage

Hit `ctrl+space` (or `command` for mac users) and type "link with editor".

Select this choice, and the workspace should now display (and highlight if you
did the CSS config) the file being edited.

## Known issues

* Sometimes the plugin has no effect, and the workspace does not wriggle at
  all. Must investigate on this.

## TODO

* use for CSS styling
  <https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-load-custom-css-files-at-startup>
* raise an event to display workspace sidebar if required
* change behavior file format
* add keymap

## Changelog

* 0.0.1 Initial release.
